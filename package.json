  "description": "The company first asks you to create a small prototype, which it will present to its teams to assess whether such a website could be useful to them. For this project, you will have to store data and display it in a browser. To do this, you will discover databases with MySQL and make a small web application. The prototype will be very simple and will have only two pages: a page to create a schedule, and a page to display all existing schedules.",
